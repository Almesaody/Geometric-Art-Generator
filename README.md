Hello everyone We’ll learn how to make a Geometric Art Generator which will create a geometry of different shapes that will look like a puzzle here the most important part is JavaScript code. In Today’s session, We will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete this Geometric Art Generator Project.

* Step 1
The HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) will help us to create the structure for the list with some necessary attributes and elements to make Geometric Art Generator Project.

Then we will use CSS (Cascading Stylesheet) which will help us to style or design the project with suitable padding and alignment in the Geometric Art Generator Project.

* Step 3
At last we will use JS (JavaScript) which will add a logic to make the Geometric Art Generator Project responsive from the user end.

Second comes the CSS code in which we have styled for the structure we have padded as well as aligned the Geometric Art Generator project so that it is properly situated and doesn’t get messy with suitable CSS elements. Now lets code the JavaScript part to make responsive.

## JavaScript Code for Geometric Art Generator
Last stage of the project the JavaScript which we added the logic and coded as per the requirement with some conditions. We defined the shapes in the beginning and then we used mathfloor function to make the shapes random.
